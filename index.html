<h2 style="font-size: 2rem; text-align: center;">My attempt to write a summary</h2>
<p style="font-size: 150%; margin: 40px;">
  From the last chapters which I have read, I have found out Timber's story.  One day, after watching <i>An Affair to Remember</i>, an old Hollywood romantic movie, Margo talked about her feelings of love she had felt some time ago. She compared it with a deep, eternal blue that lives in the sky. Her words touched all of her friends and Timber decided to tell them his story about his love. Timber used to not tell anyone this story but he needed to do it and share his feelings. It was a sad story. It was a story about his childhood, how he had been able to hear trees, how he had become a carver. Learning to carve he moved to a city by the sea where he met a girl who admired a fiddler which Timber carved.  Her name was Sylvan. He fell in love with her and a few months after they got married. He became a good carver and they could afford to buy a cozy house. They were happy when one day Sylvan was hit by a drunk driver. She came into a coma. Doctors could do nothing to wake up her. Timber spent every day near her and one lucky day she woke up. Timber was happy. He thought everything would become like before the accident. But unfortunately, Sylvan's brain had been damaged and she lost his memory. She didn't understand who she was, where she was, and who he was. He and the doctors tried to force her to remember anything but they couldn't do it. Care for Sylvan was so expensive that Timber was forced to sell their house and belongings. One thing he couldn't sell was Eudora, a houseplant they much liked. Gradually, Timber began to lose hope. He began drinking and his visits to her became rarer. He couldn't continue to look at her empty eyes and eventually, he abandoned everything, took a bus, and went away. He began living on the street. He was alone until Emelia approached him.
The next day after Timber said his story he went away. His friends knew nothing where he was and what he did. They contacted the police and media and they found out that Timber withdrew a few hundred dollars in the first three days. After that withdrawals stopped. They didn't know where to find him. Luckily, Dick watched <i>E.T.</i>, a movie about an extraterrestrial who managed to return home and he understood where Timber could be.
